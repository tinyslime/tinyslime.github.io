        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>The year is 2057. The Sun, humanity's life source, is dying, plunging Earth into a new ice age.
         A desperate crew of eight astronauts aboard the Icarus II embarked on a perilous mission. 
         Their goal: detonate a massive nuke within the Sun to make it work again (??).
          The journey has lots of danger (???), but the crew faces an even greater threat 
          when they pick up a distress signal from Icarus I, the lost ship that tried the mission 
          seven years prior. A choice to investigate throws the mission and the crew's sanity into 
          question as they stand with the consequences of docking the ship?? (This movie makes no sense)</p>
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>The beginning of the movie starts very suddenly. We do not really know much about any of the crew members, not to mention I can barely remember their names! They start to die very abruptly, like we do not know anything about them, so why should we care?</p>
        <p>It’s not really all that bad until after the guy commits suicide, as the movie goes into the dump because the bogeyman appears! We have no clue how he got there and no clue how he is alive after 7 years. He starts killing people for no reason.</p>
        <p>To make this film better, I would’ve had them explore more about how the other crew died from being mesmerized by the sun, like Searle. Instead of having a random guy appear on the ship, I would’ve made it like the sun drives them crazy.</p>
        <p><b>Is it perfect?</b> Hell no, I really didn’t enjoy watching this film. Don’t waste your time watching this!</p>
