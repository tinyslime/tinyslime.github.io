        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>In the isolated chill of an Antarctic research station, a group of American scientists are disrupted by a frantic helicopter chase. The Norwegians from a nearby base are hot on the heels of a seemingly ordinary sled dog, firing with deadly intent. When the dog takes refuge with the Americans, things take a horrifying turn. The creature they take in is no ordinary canine – it's a shape-shifting alien that can perfectly imitate any living being it consumes.</p>
        <p>Kurt Russell portrays R.J. MacReady, the station's helicopter pilot, who finds himself leading the team in a desperate fight for survival. As paranoia sets in, the researchers can't trust anyone, not even each other. Any seemingly normal colleague could be a horrifying imposter. The Thing picks them off one by one, using their own bodies against them. MacReady, with the help of the station's doctor, must find a way to unmask the alien before it's too late, all while battling the harsh wintery environment and the present fear of who – or what – is standing next to them.</p>
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>The Thing (1982) is for sure mind-blowing. This movie has kept me thinking about it for the past week.</p>
        <p>The effects are 10/10. There isn’t any CGI; all the effects are practical. Gnarly transformations, gooey bits flying everywhere – it's enough to make your stomach churn. They don't hold back on the gore, which makes the movie a little gross to watch.</p>
        <p>The characters might not be winning any Academy Awards, but they're just a bunch of scientists stuck in a frozen wasteland being stalked by an alien. Kurt Russell is awesome though. He plays MacReady, the chopper pilot.</p>
        <p><b>Is it perfect?</b>Nah, some of the guys do dumb stuff sometimes, and the ending is kinda underwhelming. Me personally, I think all of the movie is perfectly done. As I wrote, there's no need to seriously develop the characters. The Thing might leave you feeling sick due to the disturbing effects, however, you should for sure do yourself a favor and check it out!</p>
