        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>Aliens (1986) picks up decades after Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, escapes a deadly encounter with an alien creature; which I’m pretty sure is after the film Alien takes place. After being rescued from hyper sleep, Ripley struggles to convince anyone about the threat. However, when contact is lost with a colony on the same planet where she encountered the alien, Ripley is forced to return alongside a team of Colonial Marines. Upon arrival, they discover the colonists are wiped out and the horrifying truth: the aliens are back, and there's a lot more of them. Ripley, who is along with a kid survivor named Newt, must team up with the remaining marines to take on the alien menace and its monstrous queen in a fight for survival.</p>
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>Ripley makes a reappearance in Aliens (1986), and this film is pretty different compared to the last. While the Alien had creepy stalking in the dark – this film is about a whole army of aliens!</p>
        <p>This is not the average space shoot-out. The action is relentless, with heart-pounding chases, claustrophobic battles in dripping corridors, and enough firepower to light up a small moon. Honestly, this movie isn’t terrifying like The Thing, but the claustrophobic feeling of being hunted by these vicious creatures is amped up, and the special effects, even by today’s standards, hold up fantastically. The Xenomorphs are very well designed, from the terrifying face huggers to the Alien Queen.</p>
        <p>Weaver is obviously phenomenal as Ripley; probably the most iconic character in any alien movie to date. She's tough, she's resourceful, and she's about to become a surrogate mom to a little girl named Newt, who's the only other survivor on the colony. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bill Paxton as the wisecracking (and frankly expendable) Private Hudson. These marines are real people except for the robot guy but they still joke around, they bicker, and they die in spectacular ways; which makes the films excellent writing even more prevalent.</p>
        <p><b>Is it perfect?</b>Well, maybe the plot is a bit predictable – gotta save the colonists, gotta kill the queen. But you could argue that most films are predictable like that. Aliens is an amazing movie that blends action, horror, and surprisingly good characters into a sci-fi masterpiece.</p>
