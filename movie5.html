        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>Nope (2022) isn't about people fighting aliens with guns and stuff like in the movie Aliens – it's about two ranch siblings, OJ and Em Haywood, living their best life in California. They really like horses. Then bam! Something shows up in the sky, something they call the "nope" object.</p>
        <p>The Haywood siblings are hustlers though. They see dollar signs in that UFO and decide to catch it on camera – pretty sure they are trying to get on Oprah. So, they rope in a tech salesman and a documentary filmmaker to help them snag the ultimate alien evidence. Only problem? This object isn't just mysterious, it's trying to hurt them. OJ and Em gotta figure out how to get the perfect shot without getting themselves squashed by this alien saucer.</p>
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>I first heard of this movie off TikTok a couple years back, but I’ve never gotten around to watching it, so I figured now would be the perfect time.</p>
        <p>I think the most memorable part of the movie is the part where it shows the monkey going crazy and hurting all of those people. I think I missed a part because I don’t really understand 100% why that had to be there, but it was unique, nonetheless.</p>
        <p><b>Is it perfect?</b>Nope. A lot of people online when you search up the movie will say it’s very slow paced, which I kinda agree with – it didn’t need to be 2+ hours long, I bet they could’ve squeeze the move into an hour and a half. However, the movie mixes sci-fi, horror, and even a bit of western thrown in for good measure. It's supposed to make us think of stuff like how obsessed we are with capturing everything on camera and trying to control the things that are way out of our league.</p>
